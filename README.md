# Installing Local Repository using Shell Script

This shell script is designed to install a local repository. Please note that it's intended for use within a closed network, hence the ISO file should be located in the same directory as the shell script.

## Instructions

1. **Place the ISO file**: Ensure that the ISO file is located in the same directory as the shell script.

2. **Execute the Shell Script**: Run the shell script using bash. You can do this by navigating to the directory containing the script in the terminal and executing the following command:

    ```bash
    bash script_name.sh
    ```

    Replace `script_name.sh` with the actual name of your shell script.

3. **Follow On-Screen Instructions**: The shell script will guide you through the installation process. Follow the prompts and provide any necessary input as required.

4. **Completion**: Once the installation is complete, the local repository should be set up and ready for use within your closed network.

## Important Note

- This script assumes that the ISO file contains the necessary repository data. Ensure that the ISO file is correctly configured to serve as a repository source before running the script.
- Make sure to review and understand the script before executing it, especially in production environments.

## Compatibility

This script is compatible with bash shell environments.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation process, refer to the script's documentation or seek assistance from your system administrator.
